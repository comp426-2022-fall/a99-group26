# Group 26 - UNC Student Body Blog

## Summary 

We sought to create a live-blog created with UNC students in mind. This is a place where UNC students can post and blog whatever they would like (preferrably UNC specific). Students will be able to create posts and share them at instant time. We create this by implementing React and Firebase.

## Set up
Follow the following steps to install and use our web app:
  
  1. Clone the repository using git clone
  2. Navigate to the repository, and change directory into 'blog-app'
  3. Run the following commands to install dependencies and run the website:

npm install
npm start

## Implementations

  - Sign up/log-in with Google (create, edit, delete, connect account with database)
  - Create post and connect it to Firebase Database (only logged in users can create posts)
  - Display posts for all users

## Team Planning
The planning process has been documented in this [file](doc/Planning.md). Everyone was contributing to the project and constantly merging and pulling from GitHub. We created overall design plans with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/WVtDdIZeL4nWC4gl5nEN0K/COMP-426-Project?node-id=39%3A61&t=yhiCZizVFLKHPCqM-1).

## Team Roles
We splited up the tasks and each person took roles in the project. Here's the [documentation](doc/Team.md) for how we splited the team.

## Future Implementations

For the future, we would like to add SSO authentication through UNC services to verify UNC student identities. We also want a more user friendly approach to editing posts, and implement the disappearing of posts after 24 hours. To make it possibly similar to a service like YikYak, we could implement some geotracking features as well. We would also like to possibly update the design to make it more appealing to users.
