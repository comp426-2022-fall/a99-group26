## Set up

## Team Planning
The planning process has been documented in this [file](doc/Planning.md). Everyone was contributing to the project and constantly merging and pulling from GitHub.

## First steps

Other steps that you will need to take after your team has accepted the assignment:

1. Choose a license and update the LICENSE file accordingly. 
2. Edit this README.md file and use it as the main location of your technical documentation with links out to information contained under `/docs/`.
3. Create a `/docs/` directory for more elaborate documentation of your API, planning notes, etc.
4. Make sure that all of your team members have access to the repository as administrators.
5. Create a project under the **Projects** tab. Use this to manage your planning. Create a To-do list, etc. Explore the tools available and user them to manage your project.
7. Assign team roles and include a listing of those roles in this README.md file or in another file under `/docs/`.
8. Then put your entire development workflow in this repository.
9. Use **Pull requests** to propose changes and incorporate them into your code from various team members. 
10. Use **Issues** to identify and track bugs and also to communicate about various aspects of the project.

## Team Roles
We splited up the tasks and each person took roles in the project. Here's the [documentations](doc/Team.md) for how we splited the team.
