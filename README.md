## UNC Blog

## Summary 

YikYak is a pretty popular app nowadays where people can share their thoughts anonymously and people within the same area range will be able to see it. This project our team created acts like a web version of YikYak only for UNC students. Students will be able to create posts and share them at instant time.

## Team Planning
The planning process has been documented in this [file](doc/Planning.md). Everyone was contributing to the project and constantly merging and pulling from GitHub.

## Team Roles
We splited up the tasks and each person took roles in the project. Here's the [documentation](doc/Team.md) for how we splited the team.

## Future Implementations
For the future, we would like to add the functionality of posting anonymously and adding the UNC login for verification of UNC students. We also wwant to make it more user friendly and users will have the ability of editing current posts. We want to implement the functionality where users can choose to make the posts disappear after 24 hours. This will make it convenient for those who doesn't want the post to be seen after 24 hours in public but want to access it themself after the 24 hours period.
